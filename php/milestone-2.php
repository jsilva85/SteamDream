    <h4> <strong>About me</strong></h4>
    <p>I've been detailing my own cars for years always learning more and more. Attended optimum detailing training in Memphis Tennessee to learn how to use their products the correct way and fine tune my technique. I specialize in maintenance washes leaving the car scratch free. Paint correction polishing the paint not only safely but not removing more clear coat than needed and leaving the deepest shine possible. Certified to install optimum ceramic coating and authorized with IGL which is a semi permanent wax giving the car a sacrificial layer that is harder than the clear coat maintaining the deep shine protected from the elements. </p>
