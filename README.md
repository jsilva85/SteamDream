# SteamDream
personal website

# Milestone 3
You have done a lot of work on the site.
...but there are some more things to fix such as:

- horizontal scroll
- not mobile responsive
- form submit refreshes page instead of making ajax call
- a bunch of errors - Use this validator to check for errors: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsteamdreamautodetailing.site%2F
- Form validation doesn't work.
- jquery is not loaded 
- parallax is not loading

You will have a nice site after fixing these things.

At this point the site is a grade of tier 2.
